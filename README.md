# IP_UA_python_sys_info

A simple IP Python UserApp the writes out key Python info to the IP MessageBoard or to a text file including:
- Python Version
- IP Installation Folder
- Path of the Python install
- Current Working Directory
- Installed Python libraries

## Known Issues / Future Work
If two versions of Python are installed (Anaconda and Python 3.6) then the code will only pick up one of these versions.

## Installing
Clone the repo to your IP UserApp folder, usually at: `C:\Users\#USERNAME#\AppData\Local\IntPetro46\UserPrograms`
